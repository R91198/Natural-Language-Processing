    "##### This is how we implement Bag of Words to a text data and one more thing to note that there is a major drawback in this which is that in the reperesentation matrix above we only see the values in the form of '1's and '0's, and because of that we are not able to distinguish that which word is more important than the other as they have similar vectors. So, in order to solve this problem, we have something called TF-IDF i.e. Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency"
